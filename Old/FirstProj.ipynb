    "# App Market Performance Analysis - Where App Devs Should Focus Next\n",
    "\n",
    "The smartphone industry has grown immensely over the last decade. Having a pocket-sized super-computer has become the norm in the United States and across the world. In 2020 it is projected that while 96% of adults in the United States will have a cellphone of some variety, 81% of the same demographic will have a smartphone \\[1\\]. It is also interesting that among adults 18-29 years old, 96% of them have a smartphone. There is reason to believe that the smartphone industry is performing well and will continue to do so until a new technology to consume information is adopted. It is difficult for a firm to break into the smartphone manufacturing industry since it is currently dominated by Apple and other established tech companies that utilize Android software, such as Google. Thankfully, smartphones perform many of their tasks with applications that are specialized in a large variety of subjects such as news, education, and gaming. These applications can be written by app developers, allowing firms to get into the smartphone industry. Apple and Google both have online stores where applications can be downloaded to devices and users can complete various tasks with them. Metrics about the 'apps' are recorded or displayed in the application stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some apps perform much better than others based on function, price, and feedback. Free apps that perform well will often have ads for items ranging from insurance to dog food. Application developers that make free apps will make money based on the number of users that see and interact with ads. For this project, I will be acting as a data scientist for a company, Firm-A, that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. They only build apps that are free to download and install, targeted at English-speaking audiences, and their main source of revenue is in-app ads. With that in mind, the revenue generated by an  app is influenced by the number of smartphone owners who use the app — the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. My goal for this project is to analyze individual app data scraped from both application stores and identify well-performing app genres. That information will help Firm-A's developers understand what type of apps they should consider creating to maximize user engagement and the number of installs.\n",

    "Project Scope:\n",
    "- Firm-A develops free to download and install apps\n",
    "- Revenue is based on the number of users viewing and engaging with in-app ads\n",

    "The data sets I am using hold a lot of information about applications available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. For both data sets, each row stores information for a different app and contains columns such as the app name, file size, price, average rating, number of ratings, content rating, genre, and devices supported. The Apple Store data set was scraped using Itunes Search API and uploaded to Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps). The Google Play Store data set was scraped directly from the website and made available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps). The first step in my project is to import the data into the coding environment Jupyter Notebook. In the code below I import both of the data sets discussed above.\n",

    "Looking at the data for the Apple Store it'll be useful to utilize the `user_rating_count`, or the number of ratings received for the app, and the `prime_genre`, or the genre that the app belongs to. Determining which genres get the most user ratings can be an effective indicator of user engagement. The number of installs for each app would give a more accurate picture of user engagement but that data point is not collected and available on the Apple App Store. The Google Play Store data includes the number of installs for each app in the `Installs` column. I will determine the average installs for apps in each genre, found in the `Category` column, and will determine a suggested app variety for Firm-A's development team.

Since that genre is not a well saturated one, it might be easier to create a novel idea and secure a large number of users who already engage in it. Before drawing that conclusion it may be smart to look deeper to understand why the genre performs well. Below, I will print all the applications from the Apple App Store with a genre marked as `Navigation` and then print the corresponding number of reviews."

    "Acting as a Data Scientist for Firm-A, I have located two large data sets that include information on applications from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. The app developers at Firm-A are trying to understand what type of app profile they should spend time working on. Revenue is based on the number of users who install and engage with the application so that in-app ads receive views. A well-performing app for Firm-A will be downloaded by many customers and receive many reviews. Based on that, I could use the app stores' data sets to identify genres that receive lots of user engagement in the form of feedback and installations. The first step was to clean the data. That included:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removing rows with missing data\n",
    "- Removing rows with duplicate data\n",
    "- Removing non-English speaking apps to match Firm-A's scope\n",
    "- Removing non-free applications to match Firm-A's scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Once that was completed I started my analysis by looking at the distribution of application genres in each app store. This helped me understand where app developers spend a lot of time currently. I also figured out the average number of reviews received by apps, per genre, in the Apple App Store. While a genre might have a large portion of the apps belonging to it, what I concluded is they rarely received an equally large proportion of the reviews. This trend was mirrored for the Google Play Store, by using the number of installs instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "While looking at application genres that had many installations from the Google Play Store it became clear the categories for photography and video player apps performed very well. In particular, applications that were designed to edit photos and videos were installed very frequently. I looked at the Apple App Store to confirm that there was a similar trend among media editing apps. Indeed, the data shows that comparable apps in the App Store also receive a high number of reviews. With this in mind, I would recommend that Firm-A's app developers consider making an app that can edit various types of media, photos or videos, and make an initial version available on the Google Play Store. Many high-install apps already exist there, something unique could be very successful by taking advantage of the popularity of apps already present. Developing an app that provides tutorials on how to edit based on the media's content, such as landscapes, selfies, or night time pictures might draw new users to the genre. The Apple App store does not have as many apps available that handle editing, but the ones that do exist have a large amount of user feedback. An editing application that has been tested and proven on the Google Play Store would not have difficulty securing users who frequent the App Store."
