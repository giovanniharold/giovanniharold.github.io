                                    For those unfamiliar with the Montessori Method, it is a student-oriented approach to early education developed 
                                    by Italian scientist, Maria Montessori, in the early 1900s. The program promotes the organic adoption of values 
                                    such as independence, curiosity, and enthusiasm through a self-paced and individualized curriculum. Many age 
                                    ranges will share the same space to encourage community and accountability. The Montessori method is not 
                                    suitable for everyone since there is very little structure, but I was able to flourish in the program. I attribute my 
                                    excitement for learning and pursuance of STEM subjects to the freedom I had in the classroom through 9th grade. 
                                    The community focus of Montessori also helped me adopt diversity as a core value moving into High School.

                                    Lake Forest Academy is a college preparatory high school in the Chicago suburbs with a very competitive 
                                    application process. The student body represents 35 countries across the globe and offers boarding and 
                                    day student options. Through LFA, I strengthened my understanding of the importance of diversity by 
                                    developing an appreciation for the differences in my classmate's backgrounds. As far as classwork, 
                                    my earliest experience with Python was in my computer science class that I took as an elective. I spent 
                                    a majority of my free time as a Sound Designer for the performing arts department and I spent my last year as a 
                                    Senior Theater Tech Manager. After graduating, I was hired on short notice as the Sound Director for 
                                    end-of-year ceremonies when the previously-responsible faculty member was absent for a family emergency.

                                    I spent five years at Purdue University and received my Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and 
                                    completed a University-Industry Cooperative Education Program in Engineering (See Morey Corp). I spent free time representing
                                    Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity through several positions and intramural team participation. My most rewarding 
                                    class was 'Computers in Engineering' because of the focus on integrating many coding languages into one semester-long 
                                    project. I had extensive exposure to HTML and Python before this project but the Purdue course 
                                    required HTML and Javascript for the front end, PHP and SQL for database interaction, and R for insight development. 
                                    Additionally, I learned how to incorporate the Google Maps API into the project which helped my team secure the second-best 
                                    grade among 30+ others. Since graduating, I have followed my coding passion by exploring Data Science through 
                                    various projects and online courses.

                                    Banner Day Camp is a summer camp in Lake Forest, Illinois, that aims to teach children diversity, inclusion, and 
                                    self-awareness. All team members recieve high-quality training, prior to camp starting, to ensure every camper has a 
                                    rewarding and developmental experience. While working at Banner, I had a group of 16 first-grade boys who enrolled in
                                    one of two 4-week rotations, or the whole 8 weeks. Having campers assigned to one counselor helps ensure that the camper's 
                                    individual needs, such as medical care or allergy accommodations, do not slip through the cracks. I also volunteered to be 
                                    on the extended-day crew, five counselors, who stayed at camp each day and continued activities to accommodate parents who 
                                    couldn't utilize the bus service. I developed leadership skills and enjoyed working at Banner, I would have returned if I 
                                    hadn't secured a Co-op the next semester at Purdue (See Morey Corp).

                                    Morey is a contract electronics manufacturing facility that prioritizes quality and customer service. While attending Purdue 
                                    University, I spent rotating semesters at Morey as a team member in the High Volume department. The experience was rewarding 
                                    since it complimented my coursework in Industrial Engineering. My responsibilities included defect 
                                    monitoring, identifying process improvements, and participating in/leading Kaizen events. Concepts that I learned at Purdue 
                                    allowed me to excel in those areas, but the Co-op also prepared me for working in a professional environment. My projects 
                                    had me working closely with management, manufacturing engineers, test engineers, quality engineers, IT, fabricators, 
                                    line supervisors, and operators. I believe the professional experience is where the immeasurable value of a Co-op lies, and I am incredibly 
                                    grateful I had the opportunity to gain those skills outside the classroom.

                                    Scafuri Bakery was founded in 1904 by my great great grandfather, Luigi Scafuri, and the business has remained in the family 
                                    since then. When I was younger, I spent most of my time as a baker; as my education has progressed, though, I have been able 
                                    to take on more responsibility. In the past, I created training material, led shipping order fulfillment during holiday 
                                    seasons, and I'm currently assisting with the introduction of a new menu item. During COVID-19 shutdowns in Chicago, we have 
                                    seen three prominent restaurants close their doors in Little Italy, leaving a while in local service. We are going to extend our 
                                    hours of operation and offer pizza after building renovations are complete. Since taking traditional pizza making classes, I have been working closely 
                                    with the owner to create a implementation plan, generate excitement in the community, and make our new item profitable as soon as possible.

                                    PC when I was 15 and helped my friends design theirs as well. During high school, I helped organize a school-wide LAN event 
                                    that brought together many subset communities, such as DotA 2, League of Legends, Day Z, and CS:GO, all under one roof. Now I 
                                    use video gaming as a way to stay in touch with many of my past classmates and colleagues. Games might be seen as a platform for 
                                    anti-social individuals, but through personal experience, I know that it is quite the opposite.

                                    I had my first experience with sailing when a family friend asked if he could store his sailboat, a Sunfish, at my house. In exchange for the 
                                    storage we could use the boat whenever we'd like as long as we took care of it. After a few summers with the Sunfish, a friend and I would 
                                    spend time in Michigan on a Hobie Cat 16 (pictured on the left). In 2013, we bought the Hobie Cat together and stored it with the Sunfish. The 
                                    Hobie Cat is much more difficult to operate with one person, so communication became very important. During another trip to Michigan, around the 
                                    time I turned 18, I bargained for a Chrysler 22 (pictured on the right). The same family friend and I have been working to refurbish the Chrysler 
                                    and prepare it to be a weekend cruiser. During the restoration, we have spent time sailing on Lake 
                                    Michigan in an effort to build my confidence in taking the Chrysler out next season.

                                    In 2012 I assembled my first sound system so I could listen to my mom's favorite genre: Rock and Roll. Over many years of  
									upgrading my system, I realized that sound production/design is an incredibly fun and rewarding 
                                    field. I developed a majority of my professional skills, such as live mixing, as a Sound Designer in High School. Since then, 
                                    through countless concerts, I have expanded my pallet and expertise. I had the incredible opportunity to perform several times
                                    in college and through those sets I got first hand experience with DJing and producing. At the start of the Covid outbreak, I produced 
                                    my first live stream utilizing Ableton as a mixing software. I recently acquired a CDJ controller that I am learning in my free time, along with
                                    Serato DJ software, to use in my next stream.
